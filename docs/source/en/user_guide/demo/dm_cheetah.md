# Half-Cheetah Robot

The Half-Cheetah robot is a classic continuous control task in the DeepMind Control Suite. The goal is to train a simulated bipedal robot to run at high speed and stably by controlling its joint torques.

## Task Description

HalfCheetah is a 2D half-cheetah running task, composed of 7 main body parts (1 torso and 3 sections for each of the front and rear legs), with 6 controlled joints (front and rear thighs [connected to the torso], shins [connected to the thighs], and feet [connected to the shins]). The agent applies torques to these joints as actions, aiming to make the cheetah run forward as fast and stably as possible.

## Reward Function Design

The cheetah's reward function consists of the following parts:

```python
# Velocity Reward: Tracking target speed
# Posture Reward: Maintaining a stable posture
# Total Reward = Velocity Reward + Posture Reward
```

---

## Initial State

-   Reset all finite joint angles to random values within their allowed ranges, keeping infinite range joints in their default state.
-   Generate the initial observation vector by stabilizing the torso and leg positions through multi-step physics simulation.

## Episode Termination Conditions

-   **No Fall Termination Condition** (Does not end directly due to instability)

---

## Usage Guide

### 1. Environment Preview

```bash
uv run scripts/view.py --env dm-cheetah
