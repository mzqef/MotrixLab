description: Methodology for exploring, testing, and archiving reward/penalty functions for VBot quadruped navigation. A process-oriented guide for systematic reward discovery.
---

## Purpose

This skill teaches the **methodology of reward/penalty exploration** — how to discover, test, evaluate, and archive reward signals. It is a process guide, not a recipe book.

- **How to identify** what reward/penalty to try next
- **How to formulate** a hypothesis and test it
- **How to evaluate** whether a reward change helped
- **How to archive** findings in the reward library for reuse

> **IMPORTANT:**
> - The reward function lives in `starter_kit/navigation*/vbot/vbot_*_np.py` → `_compute_reward()`.
> - Reward weights are in `starter_kit/navigation*/vbot/cfg.py` → `RewardConfig.scales` dict.
> - The reward function IS fully implemented with: position tracking (sigma=5.0), fine position tracking (sigma=0.3, threshold=1.5m), heading, forward velocity, distance_progress (linear), approach, arrival bonus (50), stop bonus, alive_bonus (conditional on NOT reached), time_decay, stability penalties, and termination (-100).
> - Anti-laziness mechanisms (conditional alive_bonus, time_decay, successful truncation) are active. Do NOT remove them.
> - Do NOT re-implement the reward function from scratch. Modify weights or add new terms incrementally.

> This skill does NOT contain reward component examples or scale tables.
> Those live in their respective locations:
>
> | What | Where |
> |------|-------|
> | Component reference & scale ranges | `starter_kit_schedule/templates/reward_config_template.yaml` |
> | Archived reward/penalty instances | `starter_kit_schedule/reward_library/` |
> | Terrain strategies & reward code | `quadruped-competition-tutor` skill |
> | Stage-specific reward overrides | `curriculum-learning` skill |
> | Reward weight search spaces | `hyperparameter-optimization` skill |
> | Visual reward debugging | `subagent-copilot-cli` skill |

## The Exploration Cycle

Reward engineering is iterative. Every change follows this cycle:

```
    ┌──────────────┐
    │   DIAGNOSE   │ ← What behavior is wrong?
    └──────┬───────┘
           ▼
    ┌──────────────┐
    │  HYPOTHESIZE  │ ← What reward signal could fix it?
    └──────┬───────┘
           ▼
    ┌──────────────┐
    │   IMPLEMENT   │ ← Minimal change, one variable at a time
    └──────┬───────┘
           ▼
    ┌──────────────┐
    │     TEST      │ ← Short run (1-2M steps), multiple seeds
    └──────┬───────┘
           ▼
    ┌──────────────┐
    │   EVALUATE    │ ← Did the hypothesis hold?
    └──────┬───────┘
           ▼
    ┌──────────────┐
    │   ARCHIVE     │ ← Record result in reward library
    └──────┬───────┘
           │
           ▼
      Next cycle
```

**Rule:** Never change more than one reward dimension per cycle. If you change both the termination penalty AND add a new gait reward, you cannot attribute outcomes.

---

## Phase 1: Diagnose

### Behavioral Signals

Before touching rewards, identify **what behavior** is wrong. Not "the reward is too low" but a concrete observable:

| Observable | Likely Reward Gap |
|------------|-------------------|
| Robot doesn't move | Missing or weak positive incentive |
| Robot moves but falls | Missing or weak stability penalty |
| Robot oscillates near goal | Reward gradient too steep near target |
| Robot takes bizarre paths | Reward hacking — high reward from unintended behavior |
| Robot crouches/crawls | Missing height maintenance signal |
| Robot ignores obstacles | Missing proximity/collision signal |
| Robot is fast but jerky | Missing smoothness penalty |
| Robot is stable but slow | Positive incentive too weak relative to penalties |
| Reward curve plateaus | Reward provides no gradient in current state region |
| **Robot stands still near target** | **alive_bonus accumulation > goal reward — see Lazy Robot Case Study below** |
| **Distance increases during training** | **Reward hacking via per-step bonus. Check alive_bonus × avg_ep_len vs arrival_bonus** |
| **Episode length near max, reached% drops** | **Robot exploiting per-step rewards instead of completing task** |

### Diagnostic Commands

```powershell
# 1. Watch the policy — ALWAYS start here before looking at numbers
uv run scripts/play.py --env vbot_navigation_section001

# 2. Train with rendering to see behavior in real time
uv run scripts/train.py --env vbot_navigation_section001 --render

# 3. TensorBoard for reward curves
uv run tensorboard --logdir runs/vbot_navigation_section001
```

### Visual Diagnosis

Use `subagent-copilot-cli` to analyze simulation frames and training curves:

```powershell
# Describe what you see, ask what reward signal is missing
copilot --model gpt-4.1 --allow-all -p "Watch this simulation frame. The robot is <describe behavior>. What reward signal might cause this?" -s
```

> **Key insight:** A reward signal is "missing" if the agent has no gradient pointing toward the desired behavior in its current state. The fix may be a new reward, a penalty, or reshaping an existing one.

---

## Phase 2: Hypothesize

### Formulating a Good Hypothesis

A testable reward hypothesis has three parts:

1. **Behavior target:** What the robot should do differently
2. **Signal mechanism:** What mathematical signal encodes that behavior
3. **Expected side effect:** What might go wrong

**Template:**

> "If I add/modify `<signal>` with weight `<w>`, the robot should `<desired behavior>`, but might also `<risk>`."

### Discovery Strategies

When you don't know what to try, use these strategies to generate candidates:

#### Strategy 1: Inversion

Take the undesired behavior and directly penalize it.

> Robot bouncing → penalize vertical velocity
> Robot spinning → penalize angular velocity
> Robot retreating → penalize backward displacement

#### Strategy 2: Shaping the Gradient

If the robot is stuck, the reward surface is flat in its current region. Add a signal that creates local gradient:

> Robot stuck far from goal → Add distance-based shaping (sigmoid, exponential)
> Robot stuck near goal → Add fine-grained proximity bonus
> Robot stuck on terrain edge → Add progress checkpoints

#### Strategy 3: Proxy Decomposition

Break the competition score into component sub-goals and create a signal for each:

> Final score = traversal + bonus zones + time bonus
> → Create separate signals for: forward progress, zone proximity, speed

#### Strategy 4: Biomimetic Analogy

What would a real quadruped "want" in this situation?

> Stairs → lift knees higher
> Uneven ground → keep center of mass low
> Obstacles → slow down, increase awareness

#### Strategy 5: Ablation Discovery

Temporarily remove one existing reward and see what degrades:

```powershell
# Remove component to see its effect
python scripts/train.py --env <env> --seed 42 --cfg-override "reward_config.scales.<component>=0.0"
```

If removing a component doesn't change behavior, it was irrelevant. If behavior collapses, it was critical.

#### Strategy 6: Competition-Score Alignment

Compare training reward to competition scoring rules. Gaps indicate missing signals:

> Competition awards points for stopping in smiley zones
> → but training reward only rewards forward velocity
> → mismatch: need a "stop in zone" signal

> **Refer to** `quadruped-competition-tutor` skill for competition scoring rules.

#### Strategy 7: Browse the Library

Check previously tried components in the reward library before inventing new ones:

```powershell
# Browse archived reward components
Get-ChildItem starter_kit_schedule/reward_library/components/ | Select-Object Name
# Read a specific component's notes
Get-Content starter_kit_schedule/reward_library/components/<name>.yaml
```

---

## Phase 3: Implement

### Principles

1. **One variable at a time** — Change a single reward component per experiment
2. **Minimal change** — Prefer adjusting a weight before adding new code
3. **Use existing infrastructure** — Check `reward_config_template.yaml` for components that can be enabled/disabled before writing new code

### Where to Make Changes

| Change Type | Location |
|-------------|----------|
| Adjust existing weight | `starter_kit/navigation1/vbot/cfg.py` → `RewardConfig.scales` dict |
| Add new reward term | `starter_kit/navigation1/vbot/vbot_section001_np.py` → `_compute_reward()` |
| Configure component | `starter_kit_schedule/templates/reward_config_template.yaml` |

### Change Magnitude Guidelines

When adjusting weights, use **multiplicative steps** not additive:

- **Small adjustment:** ×0.5 or ×2 (halve or double)
- **Medium adjustment:** ×0.1 or ×10
- **Large adjustment:** ×0.01 or ×100

For new components, start with a weight that produces reward magnitude comparable to existing dominant terms (check `reward_breakdown` logs).

---

## Phase 4: Test

### Experiment Protocol

```yaml
# Record this BEFORE running the experiment
experiment:
  id: "RPE_YYYYMMDD_NNN"         # Auto-incrementing
  hypothesis: "<one sentence>"
  change: "<what exactly changed>"
  baseline: "<what to compare against>"
  environment: "<env id>"
  seeds: [42, 123, 456]           # Minimum 3 seeds
  steps: 2_000_000                # Short exploratory run
  metrics_to_watch:
    - episode_reward_mean
    - <behavior-specific metric>
```

### Running Quick Tests

```powershell
# Quick test — single run with rendering to visually verify behavior
uv run scripts/train.py --env vbot_navigation_section001 --render

# Full AutoML test with HP search
uv run starter_kit_schedule/scripts/automl.py `
    --mode stage `
    --budget-hours 4 `
    --hp-trials 3
```

### What Counts as "Enough" Testing

| Purpose | Steps | Seeds |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Quick sanity check | 500K | 1 |
| Hypothesis validation | 2M | 3 |
| Serious candidate | 5M | 3 |
| Pre-deployment | 10M+ | 5 |

---

## Phase 5: Evaluate

### Comparison Checklist

After a test run, answer these questions:

1. **Did the target behavior improve?** (Watch the policy, not just numbers)
2. **Did any other behavior degrade?** (Side effects)
3. **Is the improvement consistent across seeds?** (Not lucky variance)
4. **Is the reward curve healthy?** (Monotonic improvement, no collapse)
5. **Did training become slower?** (Some signals slow convergence)

### Decision Matrix

| Target improved? | Side effects? | Consistent? | Verdict |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Yes | None | Yes | **ADOPT** — Archive and integrate |
| Yes | Minor | Yes | **ITERATE** — Tune weight to reduce side effect |
| Yes | Major | Yes | **RETHINK** — Signal is right, mechanism needs redesign |
| Yes | Any | No | **INCONCLUSIVE** — More seeds or longer run |
| No | — | — | **REJECT** — Archive with notes, try different approach |

### Quantitative Evaluation

Use `starter_kit_schedule/scripts/analyze.py` for systematic comparison:

```powershell
# Compare experiments by reward metric
uv run starter_kit_schedule/scripts/analyze.py `
    --metric episode_reward_mean `
    --group-by reward_config

# Visual comparison via subagent
copilot --model gpt-4.1 --allow-all -p "Compare reward curves in runs/<exp_a>/ vs runs/<exp_b>/. Which converged faster? Which is more stable?" -s
```

---

## Phase 6: Archive

### Why Archive Everything

Every experiment result — positive or negative — is valuable. Negative results prevent re-trying failed ideas. Positive results enable reuse and combination.

### Reward Library Location

All reward/penalty instances are archived in:

```
starter_kit_schedule/reward_library/
├── README.md                      # Library index and conventions
├── components/                    # Individual reward/penalty definitions
│   └── <component_name>.yaml      # One per reward idea
├── configs/                       # Complete reward configurations
│   └── <config_name>.yaml         # Tested combinations that work
└── rejected/                      # Ideas that didn't work
    └── <idea_name>.yaml           # With notes on why
```

```

### Config Archive Format

```yaml

environment: "<env id>"
date_tested: "YYYY-MM-DD"

reward_scales:

# List what's in the library
Get-ChildItem starter_kit_schedule/reward_library/components/ -Name
Get-ChildItem starter_kit_schedule/reward_library/configs/ -Name
Get-ChildItem starter_kit_schedule/reward_library/rejected/ -Name
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Changing 3+ rewards at once | Cannot attribute outcomes | One variable per cycle |
| Copying rewards from papers | Context differs | Use as hypothesis, test locally |
| Only watching reward curves | High reward ≠ good behavior | Always watch policy visually |
| Discarding failed experiments | Wastes future effort | Archive in `rejected/` |
| Tuning weights without diagnosis | Blind search | Diagnose behavior first |
| Adding rewards without removing | Reward bloat, slow training | Ablate unneeded components |
| Assuming terrain-agnostic rewards | Different terrains need different signals | Test per-terrain |
| **Unconditional per-step bonuses** | **Robot learns to survive, not navigate. alive_bonus × max_steps >> goal reward** | **Make per-step bonuses conditional (e.g., only before reaching goal)** |
| **Goal reward too small vs per-step** | **arrival_bonus=15 vs alive_bonus×3800≈1900** | **arrival_bonus must dominate: set to ≥ alive × typical_episode_len / 3** |
| **Trusting reward curves alone** | **"Reward=7.6" looked great, but robot was lazy** | **Always verify with distance, reached%, episode length metrics** |

---

## 🔴 Case Study: The Lazy Robot (Reward Hacking)

This case study documents a critical reward hacking failure discovered during Round 1 full training, and the three-pronged fix.

### Timeline

1. **Round 1 AutoML** (15 trials, 5M steps): Best trial achieved reward=6.75, reached=6.45%. Looked promising.
2. **50M full training**: Early metrics excellent — distance 7.6→0.65m, arrival_total=18.76 (~90% reach rate).
3. **At step 24320 (~30min)**: Robot became lazy. Distance went UP (0.65→1.65m), reached% dropped (2.93→0.30%), episode length near max (3777/4000).
4. **Root cause**: `alive_bonus(0.5) × ~3800 steps ≈ 1900` dwarfed `arrival_bonus = 15`. The robot discovered standing still in a safe spot was the optimal strategy.

### Detection Signals

| Metric | Healthy | Lazy Robot |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Distance to target | Decreasing → 0 | Decreasing then **increasing** |
| Reached % | Increasing | Increasing then **dropping to ~0** |
| Episode length | Moderate (500-2000) | **Near max_steps (3800+)** |
| Reward | Increasing | **Still looks good** (alive_bonus accumulates!) |
| Arrival bonus (TensorBoard) | Increasing | **Dropping toward 0** |

### The Fix: Anti-Laziness Trifecta

#### 1. Conditional alive_bonus
```python
# BEFORE (exploitable):
alive_bonus = scales["alive_bonus"]  # 0.5 every step, unconditionally

# AFTER (fixed):
alive_bonus = np.where(ever_reached, 0.0, scales["alive_bonus"])
# Once robot reaches target, alive bonus stops → no "stand around" exploit
```

#### 2. Time decay on navigation rewards
```python
time_decay = np.clip(1.0 - 0.5 * env_steps / max_episode_steps, 0.5, 1.0)
# Step 0: time_decay = 1.0 (full reward)
# Step 2000 (half episode): time_decay = 0.75
# Step 4000 (max): time_decay = 0.5
# Creates URGENCY — reach the goal early for maximum reward
# NOTE: Penalties are NOT multiplied by time_decay (stay full strength)
```

#### 3. Massive arrival_bonus
```python
# BEFORE: arrival_bonus = 15 (trivially beaten by alive_bonus accumulation)
# AFTER: arrival_bonus = 50 (searched in range [20, 100])
# Rule of thumb: arrival_bonus > alive_bonus × max_steps / 4
```

### Lesson

**Always audit the reward budget.** Compute: what is the maximum reward achievable by the desired behavior vs. by the degenerate behavior? If they're close, the agent WILL find the exploit given enough training time.

## Summary: Exploration Philosophy

1. **Diagnose before prescribing** — Watch the policy, identify the behavioral gap
2. **One variable per experiment** — Isolate cause and effect
3. **Test short, test often** — 2M step runs across 3 seeds reveal more than one 20M run
4. **Archive everything** — Positive results reuse, negative results prevent repetition
5. **Methodology over recipes** — The process of finding good rewards matters more than any specific reward
6. **Library over memory** — Store tried components in `reward_library/`, not in your head
7. **Competition ≠ training** — Verify that training rewards actually improve competition score
